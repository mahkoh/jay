# Unreleased

- Various bugfixes.
- The vulkan renderer now only renders in damaged areas. This has exposed several places
  where the damage tracking was incorrect. There might be additional damage tracking bugs.
  Such bugs manifest through flickering or through areas getting stuck with an old image.
  If you encounter such an issue, please open a bug.
- The vulkan renderer now performs blending in linear space. A green window with 50%
  opacity on top of a red window will produce a perfectly yellow image instead of a muddy
  yellow. The blend buffer is only used for those areas of the screen where blending is
  observable. This should have no impact on performance in the common case.
- Implement color-management-v1.
- Implement cursor-shape-v1 version 2.
- Outputs can now optionally use the BT.2020/PQ color space.
- Implement ext-shell version 7.
- Implement single-pixel-buffer version 2.

# 1.9.1 (2025-02-13)

This release updates the kbvm crate to fix an issue that would cause applications to
interpret the AltGr key as the Alt key.

Reported by @Honkeh in https://github.com/mahkoh/jay/issues/364.

# 1.9.0 (2025-01-27)

This release replaces xkbcommon by the kbvm crate.

This is a huge change in how input is handled. The intention is that this is completely
invisible to users.

Therefore this release contains only this change. You can downgrade to the previous
release to switch back to xkbcommon without any loss in functionality. In this case please
report what is broken.

- Various bugfixes.

- Add an idle grace period. During the grace period, the screen goes black but is neither
  disabled nor locked. This is similar to how android handles going idle. The default is
  5 seconds.
- Implement ext-workspace-v1.
