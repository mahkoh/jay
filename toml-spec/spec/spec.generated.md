# Jay TOML Config

This document describes the format of the TOML configuration of the Jay compositor.

A JSON Schema for this format is available at [spec.generated.json](./spec.generated.json). You can include this file in your editor to get auto completion.

Start at the top-level type: [Config](#types-config).

## Types

<a name="types-AccelProfile"></a>
### `AccelProfile`

The acceleration profile to apply to an input device.

See the libinput documentation for more details.

Values of this type should be strings.

The string should have one of the following values:

- `Flat`:

  The flat profile.

- `Adaptive`:

  The adaptive profile.



<a name="types-Action"></a>
### `Action`

An `Action` is an action performed by the compositor.

- Example:

  ```toml
  [shortcuts]
  alt-q = "quit"
  ```

Values of this type should have one of the following forms:

#### A string

The value should be the name of a `simple` action. See the description of that
variant for more details.

- Example:

  ```toml
  [shortcuts]
  alt-q = "quit"
  ```

The value should be a [SimpleActionName](#types-SimpleActionName).

#### An array

A list of actions to execute in sequence.

- Example:

  ```toml
  [shortcuts]
  alt-q = [
    { type = "exec", exec = ["notify-send", "exiting"] },
    "quit",
  ]
  ```

Each element of this array should be a [Action](#types-Action).

#### A table



This table is a tagged union. The variant is determined by the `type` field. It takes one of the following values:

  strings instead.

Values of this type should be strings.


<a name="types-ComplexShortcut"></a>
### `ComplexShortcut`

Describes a complex shortcut.

  ```

Values of this type should be tables.

The table has the following fields:

- `mod-mask` (optional):

  The mod mask to apply to this shortcut.
  
  Should be a string containing modifiers concatenated by `-`. See the description
  of `Config.shortcuts` for more details.
  
  If this field is omitted, all modifiers are included in the mask.
  
  - Example:
    
    To raise the volume whenever the XF86AudioRaiseVolume key is pressed regardless
    of any modifiers except `alt`:
  
    ```toml
    [complex-shortcuts.XF86AudioRaiseVolume]
    mod-mask = "alt"
    action = { type = "exec", exec = ["pactl", "set-sink-volume", "0", "+10%"] }
    ```
  
    Set `mod-mask = ""` to ignore all modifiers.

  The value of this field should be a string.

- `action` (optional):

  The action to execute.
  
  Omitting this is the same as setting it to `"none"`.

  The value of this field should be a [Action](#types-Action).

- `latch` (optional):

  An action to execute when the key is released.
  
  This registers an action to be executed when the key triggering the shortcut is
  released. The active modifiers are ignored for this purpose.
  
  - Example:
  
    To mute audio while the key is pressed:
  
    ```toml
    [complex-shortcuts.alt-x]
    action = { type = "exec", exec = ["pactl", "set-sink-mute", "0", "1"] }
    latch = { type = "exec", exec = ["pactl", "set-sink-mute", "0", "0"] }
    ```
  
    Audio will be un-muted once `x` key is released, regardless of any other keys
    that are pressed at the time.

  The value of this field should be a [Action](#types-Action).

  `MOD` should be one of `shift`, `lock`, `ctrl`, `mod1`, `mod2`, `mod3`, `mod4`,
  `mod5`, `caps`, `alt`, `num`, `logo`, or `release`.
  
  Using the `release` modifier causes the shortcut to trigger when the key is
  released.
  
  `KEYSYM` should be the name of a keysym. The authorative location for these names
  is [1] with the `XKB_KEY_` prefix removed.
  
  The keysym should be the unmodified keysym. E.g. `shift-q` not `shift-Q`.

    ```

  The value of this field should be a [Status](#types-Status).

- `outputs` (optional):

  An array of output configurations.
  
  This can be used to configure outputs and create named outputs that can be
  referred to in actions.
  
  The configurations defined here will only be applied the first time matching
  outputs are connected to the compositor after the compositor has started.
  If you want change the configuration afterwards, use `jay randr` or a
  `configure-output` action.
  
  - Example:
  
    ```toml
    [[outputs]]
    name = "left"
    match.serial-number = "33K03894SL0"
    x = 0
    y = 0
  
    [[outputs]]

    match.serial-number = "ETW1M02062SL0"
    x = 1920
    y = 0
    ```

  The value of this field should be an array of [Outputs](#types-Output).

- `connectors` (optional):

  An array of connector configurations.
  
  This can be used to configure connectors.
  
  The configurations defined here will only be applied when the connector is first
  discovered by the compositor. This usually never happens after the compositor has
  started unless you attach an external graphics card.
  
  - Example:
  
    ```toml
    [[connectors]]
    name = "eDP-1"
    enabled = false

  The value of this field should be a table whose values are strings.

- `on-startup` (optional):

  An action to execute as early as possible when the compositor starts.
  
  At this point, graphics have not yet been initialized. You should not use this
  to start graphical applications. See `on-graphics-initialized`.
  
  This setting has no effect during configuration reloads.

  The value of this field should be a [Action](#types-Action).

- `keymaps` (optional):

  Defines named keymaps.
  
  These keymaps can be used to easily switch between keymaps for different
  keyboards.
  
  - Example:
  
    ```toml
    keymap.name = "laptop"
  
    [shortcuts]
    alt-j = { type = "set-keymap", keymap.name = "laptop" }
    alt-k = { type = "set-keymap", keymap.name = "external" }
  
    [[keymaps]]
    name = "laptop"
    path = "./laptop-keymap.xkb"
  
    [[keymaps]]
    name = "external"
    path = "./external-keymap.xkb"
    ```

  The value of this field should be an array of [Keymaps](#types-Keymap).

- `log-level` (optional):

  Sets the log level of the compositor.
  
  This setting cannot be changed by re-loading the configuration. Use

    ```toml
    log-level = "debug"
    ```

  The value of this field should be a [LogLevel](#types-LogLevel).

- `theme` (optional):

  Sets the theme of the compositor.

  The value of this field should be a [Theme](#types-Theme).

- `gfx-api` (optional):

  Sets the graphics API used for newly discovered DRM devices.
  
  Changing this setting after the compositor has started usually has no effect
  unless you attach an external graphics card. Use `jay randr` to change the API
  used by individual devices at runtime.
  
  - Example:
  
    ```toml
    gfx-api = "Vulkan"
    ```

  The value of this field should be a [GfxApi](#types-GfxApi).

- `drm-devices` (optional):

  Names and configures DRM devices.
  
  These settings are only applied to devices discovered after the configuration
  has been loaded. Therefore changing these settings usually has no effect at
  runtime unless you attach an external graphics card. You can use `jay randr` or
  a `configure-drm-device` Action to change these settings at runtime.
  
  - Example:
  
    ```toml
    render-device.name = "dedicated"
  
    [[drm-devices]]
    name = "dedicated"
    match = { pci-vendor = 0x1002, pci-model = 0x73ff }
  
    [[drm-devices]]
    name = "integrated"
    match = { pci-vendor = 0x1002, pci-model = 0x164e }
    gfx-api = "OpenGl"
    ```

  The value of this field should be an array of [DrmDevices](#types-DrmDevice).

- `direct-scanout` (optional):

  Configured whether the compositor attempts direct scanout.

  The value of this field should be a boolean.

- `explicit-sync` (optional):

  Configures whether the compositor supports explicit sync.
