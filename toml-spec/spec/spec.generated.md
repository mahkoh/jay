# Jay TOML Config

This document describes the format of the TOML configuration of the Jay compositor.

A JSON Schema for this format is available at [spec.generated.json](./spec.generated.json). You can include this file in your editor to get auto completion.

Start at the top-level type: [Config](#types-config).

## Types

<a name="types-AccelProfile"></a>
### `AccelProfile`

The acceleration profile to apply to an input device.

See the libinput documentation for more details.

Values of this type should be strings.

The string should have one of the following values:

- `Flat`:

  The flat profile.

- `Adaptive`:

  The adaptive profile.



<a name="types-Action"></a>
### `Action`

An `Action` is an action performed by the compositor.

- Example:

  ```toml
  [shortcuts]
  alt-q = "quit"
  ```

Values of this type should have one of the following forms:

#### A string

The value should be the name of a `simple` action. See the description of that
variant for more details.

- Example:

  ```toml
  [shortcuts]
  alt-q = "quit"
  ```

The value should be a [SimpleActionName](#types-SimpleActionName).

#### A string

The value should be the name of a `named` action, prefixed with the `$` character.

This is the same as using the `named` action with the `$` removed.

- Example:

  ```toml
  [actions]
  q = "quit"

  [shortcuts]
  alt-q = "$q"
  ```

The string should match the following regular expression: `^\$.*$`

#### An array

A list of actions to execute in sequence.

- Example:

  ```toml
  [shortcuts]
  alt-q = [
    { type = "exec", exec = ["notify-send", "exiting"] },
    "quit",
  ]
  ```

Each element of this array should be a [Action](#types-Action).

#### A table



This table is a tagged union. The variant is determined by the `type` field. It takes one of the following values:

- `simple`:

  A simple action that takes no arguments. These are usually written as plain
  strings instead.

    ```toml
    [shortcuts]
    alt-q = "quit"
    ```

  The table has the following fields:

  - `cmd` (required):

    The simple action to execute.

    The value of this field should be a [SimpleActionName](#types-SimpleActionName).

- `named`:

  A named action that was defined via the top-level `actions` table or a
  `define-action` action. These are usually written as plain strings with a `$`
  prefix.
  
  - Example 1:
  
    ```toml
    [actions]
    my-action = "quit"
  
    [shortcuts]
    alt-q = { type = "named", name = "my-action" }
    ```
  
  - Example 2:
  
    ```toml
    [shortcuts]
    alt-q = [
      { type = "define-action", name = "my-action", action = "quit" },
      { type = "named", name = "my-action" },

  The value of this field should be a number.

- `list` (required):

  The list of criteria.

  The value of this field should be an array of [ClientMatchs](#types-ClientMatch).


<a name="types-ClientRule"></a>
### `ClientRule`

A client rule.

Values of this type should be tables.

The table has the following fields:

- `name` (optional):

  The name of this rule.
  
  This name can be referenced in other rules.
  
  - Example
  
    ```toml
    [[clients]]
    name = "spotify"
    match.sandbox-app-id = "com.spotify.Client"
  
    [[clients]]
    match.name = "spotify"
    action = "kill-client"
    ```

  The value of this field should be a string.

- `match` (optional):

  The criteria that select the client that this rule applies to.

  The value of this field should be a [ClientMatch](#types-ClientMatch).

  capabilities `layer-shell` and `drm-lease`. Otherwise it is granted the
  capability `drm-lease`.

  Sets the upper capability bounds for clients in sandboxes created by this client.
  
  If multiple matchers match a client, the capabilities are added.
  
  If no matcher matches a client, the bounding capabilities for sandboxes depend on
  whether the client is itself sandboxed. If it is sandboxed, the bounding
  capabilities are the effective capabilities of the client. Otherwise the bounding
  capabilities are all capabilities.
  
  Regardless of any capabilities set through this function, the capabilities set
  through this function can never exceed the client's bounding capabilities.

  The value of this field should be a [ClientCapabilities](#types-ClientCapabilities).

    action = { type = "exec", exec = ["pactl", "set-sink-volume", "0", "+10%"] }
    ```
  
    Set `mod-mask = ""` to ignore all modifiers.

  The value of this field should be a string.

- `action` (optional):

  The action to execute.
  
  Omitting this is the same as setting it to `"none"`.

  The value of this field should be a [Action](#types-Action).

- `latch` (optional):

  This registers an action to be executed when the key triggering the shortcut is
  released. The active modifiers are ignored for this purpose.
  
  - Example:
  
    To mute audio while the key is pressed:
  
    ```toml
    [complex-shortcuts.alt-x]
    action = { type = "exec", exec = ["pactl", "set-sink-mute", "0", "1"] }
    latch = { type = "exec", exec = ["pactl", "set-sink-mute", "0", "0"] }

    ```toml
    render-device.name = "dedicated"
  
    [[inputs]]
    match.is-pointer = true

  The mask containing every possible type.

- `container`:

  The mask matching a container.

- `xdg-toplevel`:

  The mask matching an XDG toplevel.

  The mask matching any type of client window.

### `WorkspaceDisplayOrder`

<a name="types-XScalingMode"></a>
### `XScalingMode`

The scaling mode of X windows.

- Example:

  ```toml
  xwayland = { scaling-mode = "downscaled" }
  ```

Values of this type should be strings.

The string should have one of the following values:

- `default`:

  The default mode.
  
  Currently this means that windows are rendered at the lowest scale and then upscaled
  if necessary.

- `downscaled`:

  Windows are rendered at the highest integer scale and then downscaled.
  
  This has significant performance implications unless the window is running on the
  output with the highest scale and that scale is an integer scale.
  
  For example, on a 3840x2160 output with a 1.5 scale, a fullscreen window will be
  rendered at 3840x2160 * 2 / 1.5 = 5120x2880 pixels and then downscaled to
  3840x2160. This overhead gets worse the lower the scale of the output is.
  
  Additionally, this mode requires the X window to scale its contents itself. In the
  example above, you might achieve this by setting the environment variable
  `GDK_SCALE=2`.



<a name="types-Xwayland"></a>
### `Xwayland`

Describes Xwayland settings.

- Example:

  ```toml
  xwayland = { scaling-mode = "downscaled" }
  ```

Values of this type should be tables.

The table has the following fields:

- `scaling-mode` (optional):

  The scaling mode of X windows.

  The value of this field should be a [XScalingMode](#types-XScalingMode).
